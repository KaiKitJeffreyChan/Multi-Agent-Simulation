# 🎮 Multi-Agent Simulation Framework 🚀  

A fun app I built for building simulations with interacting agents using Typescript.

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🌟 **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and modeling.  
- 💬 **Agent Communication**: Powerful messaging system for interactions.  
- ⏰ **Realistic Timing**: Built on Discrete-Event Simulation (DES).  
- ⚙️ **Flexible & Dynamic**: Modify models during runtime.  
- 🚦 **Performance Options**: Supports sequential or concurrent execution.
