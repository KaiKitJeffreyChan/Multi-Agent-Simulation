# 🎮 Multi-Agent Simulation Framework 🚀  

A Java-based toolkit for building simulations with interacting agents. Whether it's a city, jungle, or robot uprising, bring your ideas to life!  

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🌟 **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and modeling.  
- 💬 **Agent Communication**: Powerful messaging system for interactions.  
- ⏰ **Realistic Timing**: Built on Discrete-Event Simulation (DES).  
- ⚙️ **Flexible & Dynamic**: Modify models during runtime.  
- 🚦 **Performance Options**: Supports sequential or concurrent execution.

## 📦 Getting Started  

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaiKitJeffreyChan/Multi-Agent-Simulation.git
Build the project with Maven or Gradle.
Add it to your project and start coding!
🕹️ Quick Example
Define an agent:

java
Copy code
public class MyAgent extends Agent {
    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Agent initialized!");
    }

    @Override
    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        System.out.println("Processing: " + event);
    }
}
Set up the simulation:

java
Copy code
Environment env = new Environment();
env.addAgent(new MyAgent());
env.runSimulation();
